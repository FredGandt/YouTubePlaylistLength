# YouTubePlaylistLength
Displays the total length of YouTube playlists on their pages, such as https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mt0xqxXk7ZhHJLHSpvyBW6WVusCaenmmA (Drumatic Universe by Lemongrass)

The total time is calculated from the lengths of the videos listed in the HTML which, for **long playlists, may require scrolling** to load them all before the true total is displayed.

Not a particularly good script; consider looking for something more carefully developed.
